          <h3>What is the Tech Radar?</h3>

          <p>
            The Melhor Envio Tech Radar is a list of technologies, complemented
            by an assessment result, called
            <em>ring assignment</em>. We use four rings with the following
            semantics:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>ADOPT</strong> &mdash; Technologies we have high
              confidence in to serve our purpose, also in large scale.
              Technologies with a usage culture in our Melhor Envio production
              environment, low risk and recommended to be widely used.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>TRIAL</strong> &mdash; Technologies that we have seen work
              with success in project work to solve a real problem; first
              serious usage experience that confirm benefits and can uncover
              limitations. TRIAL technologies are slightly more risky; some
              engineers in our organization walked this path and will share
              knowledge and experiences.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ASSESS</strong> &mdash; Technologies that are promising
              and have clear potential value-add for us; technologies worth to
              invest some research and prototyping efforts in to see if it has
              impact. ASSESS technologies have higher risks; they are often
              brand new and highly unproven in our organisation. You will find
              some engineers that have knowledge in the technology and promote
              it, you may even find teams that have started a prototyping
              effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HOLD</strong> &mdash; Technologies not recommended to be
              used for new projects. Technologies that we think are not (yet)
              worth to (further) invest in. HOLD technologies should not be used
              for new projects, but usually can be continued for existing
              projects.

          <p>
            The Tech Radar is a tool to inspire and support Engineering teams at
            Melhor Envio to pick the best technologies for new projects; it
            provides a platform to share knowledge and experience in
            technologies, to reflect on technology decisions and continuously
            evolve our technology landscape. Based on the
            <a href="https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/">
              Zalando Tech Radar </a
            >, which follows the
            <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar">
              pioneering work of ThoughtWorks </a
            >, our Tech Radar sets out the changes in technologies that are
            interesting in software development &mdash; changes that we think
            our engineering teams should pay attention to and use in their
            projects.

          <h3>How do we maintain it?</h3>

          <p>
            The Tech Radar is maintained by our team at Melhor Envio. Assignment
            of technologies to rings is the outcome of ring change proposals,
            which are discussed and voted on. The Tech Radar is open for
            contribution for all Engineering teams at Melhor Envio and depends
            on their active participation to share lessons learned, pitfalls,
            and contribute to good practices on using the technologies.<br />
